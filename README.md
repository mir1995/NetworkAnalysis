441 Edges - frequent co-purchasing of books by the SAME BUYERS, as indicated by the "customers who bought this book also bought these other books" feature on Amazon. This explains why there are no multiple edges.

Nodes have been given values "l", "n", "c" to indicate whether they are "liberal", "neutral", or "conservative".  The books were labelled separately by Mark Newman based on a reading of the descriptions and reviews of the books posted on Amazon.
